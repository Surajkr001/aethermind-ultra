# AetherMind Ultra

Autonomous, browser-based, self-healing AI assistant using best free LLMs (Gemma, TinyLlama, DistilGPT2, etc.)â€”deployable on GitHub Pages.

## Overview

AetherMind Ultra is an innovative AI assistant designed to run entirely within your web browser. It leverages cutting-edge, lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent responses and perform various tasks without relying on external servers. This ensures privacy, reduces operational costs, and makes the AI accessible to everyone.

## Features

*   **In-Browser LLM Inference:** Powered by WebLLM, AetherMind Ultra runs AI models directly in your browser, utilizing WebGPU for hardware acceleration.
*   **Voice-Enabled Interaction:** Seamlessly interact with the AI using voice commands and receive spoken responses.
*   **Self-Healing Capabilities:** Designed to automatically adapt and utilize the best available free LLM, ensuring continuous operation.
*   **OpenAI API Compatibility:** Easily integrate with existing AI applications or services that use the OpenAI API.
*   **Lightweight Models:** Utilizes efficient models like Gemma and TinyLlama for optimal performance on various devices.
*   **Easy Deployment:** Deployable on platforms like GitHub Pages for simple and free hosting.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** For building the user interface.
*   **Vite:** A fast build tool for modern web projects.
*   **WebLLM:** High-performance in-browser LLM inference engine.
*   **Gemma (Google DeepMind):** Lightweight, state-of-the-art open models.
*   **Xenova/transformers.js:** For running transformer models in the browser.
*   **Hugging Face API:** Fallback for remote LLM inference.
